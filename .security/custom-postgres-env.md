The current_setting('custom.secret_key') is the correct way to retrieve a custom configuration setting in PostgreSQL. The challenge is getting that "custom.secret_key" set in the first place, with its value coming from a Docker Compose environment variable.

Here's how you can initialize the encryption_key with a value from an environment variable when running PostgreSQL with Docker Compose:

## 1. Define the Environment Variable in your docker-compose.yml:

You need to pass the SECRET_KEY (or whatever you want to call your environment variable) to the PostgreSQL container. Then, within the PostgreSQL container's startup, you can set a custom configuration parameter using that environment variable.
YAML

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:latest # Or a specific version
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: your_database_name
      POSTGRES_USER: your_user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: your_password
      SECRET_KEY: ${YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY} # This is your environment variable
    command: postgres -c "custom.secret_key=${SECRET_KEY}" # Pass it as a custom setting
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'

volumes:
  pgdata:
```

Explanation:

    SECRET_KEY: ${YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY}: This line defines an environment variable SECRET_KEY within the db service.

        ${YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY}: This uses Docker Compose's variable interpolation. It means Docker Compose will look for an environment variable named YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY in the shell where you run docker compose up or in a .env file in the same directory as your docker-compose.yml.

            Important Security Note: Directly passing sensitive information like SECRET_KEY via environment variables in docker-compose.yml or a .env file might not be the most secure approach for production environments. For true production setups, consider using Docker Secrets or a dedicated secrets management tool. However, for development or simple scenarios, this approach is common.

    command: postgres -c "custom.secret_key=${SECRET_KEY}": This is the crucial part.

        We override the default PostgreSQL container command.

        -c "custom.secret_key=${SECRET_KEY}" tells PostgreSQL to set a custom configuration parameter named custom.secret_key with the value of the SECRET_KEY environment variable that was passed into the container.

        The custom. prefix is important for custom settings in PostgreSQL.

## 2. Ensure YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY is Set:

You have two primary ways to set YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY so Docker Compose can pick it up:

    Using a .env file: Create a file named .env in the same directory as your docker-compose.yml with the following content:

    YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY=your_very_secret_encryption_key_here

    Docker Compose will automatically load variables from this file.

    Setting it in your shell: Before running docker compose up, export the environment variable in your terminal:
    Bash

    export YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY="your_very_secret_encryption_key_here"
    docker compose up -d

## 3. Your SQL Function (as provided):

Your SQL function is already set up to retrieve this custom setting:
SQL

```sql
-- Function to encrypt sensitive data
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION encrypt_sensitive_data_func(plain_data TEXT)
RETURNS BYTEA AS $$
DECLARE
    encryption_key TEXT := current_setting('custom.secret_key'); -- Value from the custom setting
    iv BYTEA;
    encrypted_bytes BYTEA;
BEGIN
    IF plain_data IS NULL THEN
        RETURN NULL;
    END IF;

    -- Generate a random 16-byte IV for AES-256
    iv := gen_random_bytes(16);
    -- Encrypt the data using AES-256 in CBC mode
    -- The pgcrypto function expects BYTEA for data, key, and IV
    encrypted_bytes := pgp_sym_encrypt_bytea(plain_data::bytea, encryption_key::bytea, 'aes256'::text, iv);
    -- Store the IV concatenated with the encrypted data
    RETURN iv || encrypted_bytes;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

How it all works together:

    You define YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY (e.g., in a .env file).

    Docker Compose reads this variable.

    When starting the db service, Docker Compose passes the value of YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY as the SECRET_KEY environment variable to the PostgreSQL container.

    The command in docker-compose.yml then tells PostgreSQL to set its internal custom configuration parameter custom.secret_key to the value of the SECRET_KEY environment variable.

    Your PL/pgSQL function encrypt_sensitive_data_func then uses current_setting('custom.secret_key') to read this value and use it as the encryption_key.

This setup allows you to manage your encryption key outside of your SQL script, making it easier to change and more secure by keeping it out of version control if you use a .env file that's ignored by Git.
